HER, a new Text Format |Build Status|
=====================================

Whatâ€™s HER?
-----------

HER is text format, like XML/Json. The difference is that HER is easier
than others. Just see:

```
- Category -
    >> Array[]
    * Array[] = "Umh, that's pretty good!"
```

Why shall I use HER?
--------------------

As I said before, HER is **simple** and **easy to use**. You can pass
informations, or better, store informations and document them.

Feel the difference:

**XML:**

```xml
<christmas>
    <greetings>Merry christmas!</greetings>
    <greetings>Spam, PHP, Eggs</greetings>
</christmas>
```

**HER:**
```
- Christmas -
    >> Greetings[]
    * Greetings[] = "Merry christmas!"
    * Greetings[] = "Spam, PHP, Eggs"
```
